# Portfolio-Project
This is my web site that shows some of my abilities as far as front end development, HTML and CSS, as well as some of my abilities with Javascript. This isn't just a portfolio for me but a way to tell my story. I have been able to beat the odds and have rebuilt myself from scratch and experience more times than I'd like to count, however I keep going. I hope that this will demonstrate some of my abilities and will help you to decide to chose me for services/employment... Thank you...
