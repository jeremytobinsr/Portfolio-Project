                    I have been working with computers most of my life. I have always been good with hardware as well as install and troubleshooting of software. I only dabbled in coding. Now that I have begun my jouney to properly learn how to code, I want to learn more! I am a sponge and a quick learner.

                    While in high school I paid my own way and attended both high school and college in my senior year. I served in both the Army and the Nation Guard from 1996 to 2003. While on active duty I was deployed to Egypt for six months. During those six months I was able to learn to speak as well as began to read and write Arabic. I have great attention to detail and am able to work well under pressure. I am not only a Veteran but also a father of five children. They range in age from 20 years old to 3 1/2 years old. On top of that I am also a musician. I sing, play guitar, bass and drums. I was in a band named Junkhead for 5 years. in said band I played drums and helped produce two lp's and three ep's. I still write music to this day, it has been the only constant in my life since birth. I am completely self taught in about 80% of the things I know. The other 20% is through schooling or on the job training.

                    In 2011 I decided to go back to school for Medical Assistant at Branford Hall Career Institute. I completed the schooling in 2012 with a 4.98 GPA. I was able to accomplish that all while going through some very difficult personal battles.
