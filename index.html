                <p class="center"> While in high school I paid my own way and attended both high school and college in my senior year. I served in both the Army and the Nation Guard from 1996 to 2003. While on active duty I was deployed to Egypt for six months. During those six months I was able to learn to speak as well as began to read and write Arabic. I have great attention to detail and am able to work well under deadlines.  </p>
