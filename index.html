                    I have been working with computers most of my life. I have always been good with hardware as well as install and troubleshooting of software. I only dabbled in coding. Now that I have begun my journey to properly learn how to code, I want to learn more! I am a sponge and a quick learner.

                    While in high school I paid my own way and attended both high school and college in my senior year. I served in both the Army and the Nation Guard from 1996 to 2003. While on active duty I was deployed to Egypt for six months. During those six months I was able to learn to speak as well as began to read and write Arabic. I have great attention to detail and am able to work well under pressure. I am not only a Veteran but also a father of five children. They range in age from 20 years old to 3 1/2 years old. On top of that I am also a musician. I sing, play guitar, bass and drums. I was in a band named Junkhead for 5 years. In said band I played drums and helped produce two lp's, three ep's and a DVD. I still write music to this day, it has been the only constant in my life since birth. I am completely self taught in about 80% of the things I know. The other 20% is through schooling or on the job training.

                    In 2011 I decided to go back to school for Medical Assistant at Branford Hall Career Institute. I completed the schooling in 2012 with a 4.98 GPA. I was able to accomplish that all while going through some very difficult life changes. Unfortunately, a combination of childhood trama, life chioces with poor medical and mental health providers, The battle lasted a lot longer than it should have.

                    Fast forward five years, I had hit rock bottom in January of 2017. I had lost my family twice at this point. Enough was enough, so I spent that year rebuilding myself. Getting better both mentally and physically. Learning more about me, things I didn't know or were in denial about. I had begun the process of beating addiction and unlearning all the toxic things I thought were normal. It was a hard fight, but one I would do again if it meant I would be where I am today. I am happy to say I made it through and am here today ready for anything. I am stronger than I have ever been in my life. I got my family back and have built a good life for them. I am ready for the next step, and where ever it takes me, I know I'll succeed. It's what I do because I never give up!
